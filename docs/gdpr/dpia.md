**Last Updated:** January 16, 2025  
**Purpose:** This document provides a template for conducting Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) as required by GDPR Article 35.

## When is a DPIA Required?

A DPIA is required when processing is likely to result in a high risk to individuals' rights and freedoms, particularly when:

- Systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects (profiling)
- Large-scale processing of special categories of data
- Systematic monitoring of publicly accessible areas
- Processing involving automated decision-making with legal effects
- New technology or processing methods
